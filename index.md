## About me

---

I am a student at the [Wilhelm-Gymnasium Hamburg](https://www.wilhelm-gymnasium.de/), currently residing in Hamburg. I am 17 years old and anticipate completing my Abitur in 2024. My passion lies in the fields of computer science and mathematics. In my free time, I delve into various programming languages, starting with Scratch four years ago and progressing to Python. Over time, I expanded my expertise to include compiled, low-level languages such as C++ and Fortran.

Beyond programming, I am deeply interested in theoretical computer science, exploring topics like cryptography, complexity theory, and algorithms. My skills also extend to software design, including database creation and website development. I have successfully implemented several web development projects using Flask with SQLite3 backend and HTML/JS/CSS frontend.

I founded the Coding Club at Wilhelm-Gymnasium Hamburg, where I share my knowledge by teaching fellow students how to code. Python is my language of choice for personal project backends, many of which are hosted on my server, and I'm eager to share them with you.
